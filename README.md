# connectomic-paper-datasets
Collection of connectomic papers and datasets.
Public available annotated EM datasets with papers and download paths are in [connectomic-datasets.xlsx](https://github.com/Levishery/connectomic-paper-datasets/tree/main/connectomic-datasets.xlsx). Please tell me if any dataset is missing.

Recommended code: a deep learning framework powered by PyTorch for automatic and semi-automatic semantic and instance segmentation in connectomics, which is called [PyTorch Connectomics (PyTC)](https://github.com/zudi-lin/pytorch_connectomics). [[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05754)]

## visualization 
If you want to use neuroglancer to visualize your own EM image and segmentation, please refer to my notes in [neuroglancer_EM&seg](https://github.com/Levishery/connectomic-paper-datasets/blob/main/neuroglancer/neuroglancer%E5%8F%AF%E8%A7%86%E5%8C%96%E6%9C%AC%E5%9C%B0EM%26segmentation.pdf)

## annotation process
The ids of the glia segments we annotated is in [annotation](https://github.com/Levishery/connectomic-paper-datasets/tree/main/annotation).
